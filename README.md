Search-Engine
=============

Search Engine for entire Wikipedia(English) data. Designed a scalable and efficient search engine using the wikipedia data. The search engine took less than a sec to search even the longest queries(tested upto 10 words per query) . It supports field queries (for 5 fields- title, infobox, outlinks, category and content) and the index size was less than 1/4 of the data size. Build my own indexing mechanism not using nutch or lucene to index the wikipedia data. Added Features: This search engine involved creation of secondary and tertiary indices as well. The end result was a robust search engine parsing almost every query.
