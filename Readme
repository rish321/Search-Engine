1. Split files:
	install.sh xml_file_name
2. Make Index:
	run.sh xml_file_name Index_file_name
3. Make Secondary_Index:
	secondary.sh Index_file_name
4. Search Query:
	search.sh Index_file_name
*clarifications needed
*data split and secondary index will be made in the folder of script files so have enough disk space
*search.sh currently assumes that we have Index file name
*you can enter queries untill you press a blank enter (only a return char)
